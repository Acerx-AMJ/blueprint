### About
Top-down blueprint, research and automation game. The player harvests materials from the ground and makes other materials, such as silicone and power. From power, you're able to make research points. Research and materials are used to get new technologies, such as more effective drills and electronics. With electronics, you're able to make money in many different ways, like utilizing the internet module or a variety of chips. With the money you can expand your land and unlock even better technologies, in turn making you more and more money.

The player starts out with nothing but a storage module and the ability to mine materials by hand. After getting some, they can buy drills and other starting technologies to automate the process.

The player is the cursor, which can mine the most simple ores and store up to 30. The player can also drag around up to 30 of any material between machines.

- Square connections input/output materials or currency
- Circular connections input/ouput some measurement, like amount of power or litres of water

### Based off
- Upload Labs (nodes and connections, style, automation, as well as research)
- Mindustry (materials and schematics. research too)
- Infinitode 2 (research tree, style, element mining)
- Factorio (automation)
